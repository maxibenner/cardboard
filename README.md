## FAQ

**Can I sign up?**
<br />
Unfortunately, no. Because of the lack of a payment mechanic this project is in friends & family mode. If you really want to sign up, reach out to benner@fotura.co and maybe we can work something out.
<br />
<br />
**Can I host my own version of Cardboard?**
<br />
Yes. The current build is optimized for use with Wasabi cloud storage and firebase.
