A minimalist cloud storage platform for digitized home movies. The original version included automated clip splitting which has since been deactivated on client request. The code for it can still be found in the cardboard-api.

## FAQ

**Can I order images?**
<br />
No, this project has been discontinued. The github page exists to showcase what it once was. If you are really excited about it, feel free to contact me on github or through benner@fotura.co.
<br />
<br />
**Did the images fool people into thinking they were real photos?**
<br />
Yes, everyone. I still cherish the time when a photographer suggested I retouch the brown spots on the leaves in the scincare image.
